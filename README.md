> Formula 1 cars have multiple KPIs which are used to access and strategise to maximise the available points. My Strategy aims to consider the data of the Free Practice and Qualifyings to display data regarding possible positions which can be achieved in the race. This is achieved taking into considering multiple factors like previous race performance, pace set in FP3 and Qualifying, tires. Currently in RnD will start updating from 20/06 :D :O. \(^-^)/
